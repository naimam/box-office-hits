# Project Overview
This project explores box office trends over time to uncover the key factors that contribute to a movie’s financial success. Through comprehensive visual analysis, we aim to answer questions like:
Which genres, franchises, and studios consistently perform well at the box office?
How have streaming platforms and digital distribution disrupted traditional revenue models?
What was the impact of COVID-19 on the film industry, and has it fully recovered?
Do certain directors or actors consistently bring in higher revenues?
How does ROI vary between low-budget films and blockbusters?
Is a larger production budget a reliable predictor of success?
Does release timing (e.g. summer, holidays) affect a movie’s financial outcome?
Our goal is to provide both industry professionals and film enthusiasts a deeper understanding of evolving box office dynamics.
